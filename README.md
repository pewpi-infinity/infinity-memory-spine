# 🧱📍 Infinity Memory Spine

This repo is NOT a code repo.
It is NOT a storage dump.
It is NOT cloned by workers.

It is a **time-indexed memory cylinder**.

- Memory is append-only
- Addressed by hash
- Observed by other repos
- Never imported
- Never rewritten

Physics analogy:
Resonance, not files.
